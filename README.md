# GroovyGradientMesh 🎨

Welcome to **GroovyGradientMesh**, a fun and dynamic repository that makes your web background more alive than ever! This interactive project changes the background color based on your mouse movement, creating a smooth and aesthetic visual experience.

## Description

Built with the intent of turning your dull static backgrounds into groovy, energetic spaces, GroovyGradientMesh uses a radial gradient to create an immersive effect. The momentum and decay parameters control the fluidity and speed of the change. With a multi-gradient feature, the color scheme creates a bounce effect when the gradient "hits" the edges of the screen. 

## Features

- **Radial Gradient**: Creates a circular pattern of colors that adds depth to your background.
- **Momentum & Decay**: Provides a smooth and responsive transition of colors.
- **Multi-Gradient**: Adds diversity and richness to the color scheme.
- **Bounce Effect**: Ensures the gradient transition does not end abruptly at the edges but rather creates a vibrant bounce effect.

## Development Progress 🚧

| Technology | Status |
|:----------:|:------:|
|   React    |   🚧   |
|   jQuery   |   🚧   |
|     DOM    |   ✔️   |

The project is primarily built in **React**, **jQuery**, and regular **DOM Manipulation**. Currently, the functionality with regular DOM manipulation is fully operational, while the implementations for React and jQuery are still in progress.

## Customization

In the `colors.json` file, you'll find all the pre-set color patterns. You're encouraged to change and add colors you prefer, making your web page as personalized as it can get!
